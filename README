This is an unofficial script that builds tree-sitter grammars that can
be used by Emacs 29 and above.

Tree-sitter language grammars are just dynamic library object files.
You need git and a C/C++ compiler to build them.

To build the language grammar for a particular language, run

    ./build.sh <language>

e.g.,

    ./build.sh html

The dynamic library will be in directory /dist.

To build all modules at once, run

    ./batch.sh

This gives you C, JSON, Go, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Python, Typescript
(tsx), C# (csharp), C++ (cpp), Rust, etc, etc. The complete list is in
batch.sh. If you don't see your favoriate language in the list, submit
a PR.

You can enable parallel build with the JOBS variable, like this:

    JOBS=8 ./batch.sh
